# Monke Mod Manager not official

<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/The-Graze/MonkeModManager">Here is the official one</a></li>

<span>
This program will install custom mods into Gorilla Tag automatically, and can be re-run in order to update the mods
</span>
This uses the github api to get the latest release of all these mods, so you know you'll always be getting the latest version!
(If you've made a mod that you want added to the installer, send me a message on Discord! `the.graze`)

## To have your modded added
DM me:
* The Github repository of the mod you want added 
* Any dependencies
Mod submission is likely subject to change in the future.
### Ensure that
* your mod is built in the monke mod manager compatible format through `MakeRelease.ps1` (replace `netstandard2.0` with `netstandard2.1` in the code) or you use a DLL in your release
* you list the correct dependencies
* your mod is fully working
